# Food Quick using Java and Microsoft SQL Database

## This is a Program that simulates a food order and delivery system.

There are drivers, restaurants and menus for each restaurant and a database was set up accordingly. Drivers have loads according to deliveries and locations they are in.
Orders taken also have a location and are assigned to drivers in the same location that have the least load of deliveries. Once a order was placed successfully a invoice is printed.
